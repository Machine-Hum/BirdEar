# BirdEar
Birdear is an open source hardware project that aims to build embedded hardware for classifying acoustic data. It uses and STM32 microcontoller, 18650 battery and a neural network build from Tensorflow lite for Microcontrollers. It is designed to be inexpensive so several units can be placed cheaply.

It was also me and Jin's capstone project.
