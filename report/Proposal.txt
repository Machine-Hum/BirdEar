4. Signal processing
This project is required to utilize several signal processing techniques. Some of these techniques could be included filters, discrete Fourier transforms, and so on.
Filters are necessary to improve the quality of the bird calls and remove unwanted noises.
In addition, in order to come up with digitized data from acoustic analog signals, other techniques could be applied such as Discrete wavelet transform, 
mel-frequency cepstrum. In this case, MATLAB can be a simulating tool.

5. Possible obstacles
- 
- Define a concise and useful dataset in each stage (ex: before/after calculations and NN)
- Every circumstance produces different noises; therefore, finding proper filters to samples could be a major problem.

6. Software
MATLAB
C or C++
